# Day 8 – Data Governance with Unity Catalog

**@Databricks, @Codebasics and @indiandataclub #DatabricksWithIDC.**

-----------------------------------------------
Today I learned how data is organized using Catalog, Schema, and Table hierarchy.
I understood how access control works using GRANT and REVOKE.
Data lineage helped me see how data flows across pipelines.
I learned the difference between managed and external tables.
This day showed how governance and security are enforced at scale.

------------------------
I have also added my handwritten notes for Day 08.
