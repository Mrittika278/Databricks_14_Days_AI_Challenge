----------------------
Today I learned how query execution plans affect performance.
I understood different partitioning strategies for large datasets.
OPTIMIZE and ZORDER helped improve data layout and query speed.
I also explored caching techniques to reduce recomputation.
This day focused on making data pipelines faster and efficient.
