@Databricks, @Codebasics and @indiandataclub #DatabricksWithIDC.

----------------------------------

Today I learned the core components of MLflow.
I explored experiment tracking and model logging.
The MLflow UI helped visualize runs and metrics.
I understood how models are registered and managed.
This day showed how ML experiments are tracked systematically.
