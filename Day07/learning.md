@Databricks, @Codebasics and @indiandataclub along with #DatabricksWithIDC.

Hi all,Today I learned the difference between interactive notebooks and automated Databricks jobs.
I understood how multi-task workflows use DAGs to orchestrate complex pipelines.
I explored how parameters make workflows reusable and dynamic.
Scheduling and triggers help automate batch and streaming workloads.
Error handling concepts like retries and fail-fast made pipelines safer.
