# Day 6 – Medallion Architecture

Hi all,Today I understood how data flows through Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers in a structured way.
Bronze handles raw ingestion, Silver focuses on cleaning and validation, and Gold serves business-ready aggregates.
I learned best practices for keeping each layer isolated and purpose-driven.
I also explored incremental processing patterns to avoid reprocessing entire datasets.

This showed me how scalable data pipelines are built in real systems.
